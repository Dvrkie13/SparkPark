/* Whether a disc image is one the game can run from: the checks behind

 *
 * The recompiled code was made from one main.dol, so another one can't
 * run: another game, region or revision, or a different main.dol, is
 * refused. An image that only differs from the original disc elsewhere
 * often plays (WBFS and scrubbed copies leave out the disc's padding), so
 * that is the player's to decide. */
